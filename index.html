            <h3> LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF </h3>
            <p> I’m a front-end web developer specializing in WordPress. Before I started freelancing, I
                worked as a full-time Designer for a Graphics Design and web design company with hundreds of clients.
                This
                gave me experience building and maintaining a wide variety of websites, ranging from personal blogs to
                online stores to large corporate sites.
